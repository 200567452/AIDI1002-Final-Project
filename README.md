# AIDI1002-Final-Project

This project replicates the paper: Block Hankel Tensor ARIMA for Multiple Short Time Series Forecasting

source repo: https://github.com/huawei-noah/BHT-ARIMA

I test the BHT-ARIMA model against VARMAX and LSTM on ho well it can predict currency exchange rates.

data source: https://github.com/laiguokun/multivariate-time-series-data

Note: The project notebook uses a pretrained VARMAX model. I have uploaded it to Blackboard as I couldn't get it to upload here. It will have to be unzipped in the project folder for the notebook to use the model.
